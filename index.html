    <div class="abstract" id="abs1">
      This paper presents a novel mixed-integer linear optimization formulation of the AC network-constrained, cost-based, integrated expansion planning problem. The formulation is used to determine the investment needs per technology including the location and sizing of new generation, energy storage, and transmission network assets in a future low-carbon power system. To reduce the size of the resulting problem, the AC optimal power flow (AC-OPF) model is represented in a compact way using cycle constraints. A bound tightening procedure is also considered to reduce the search space and improve the solver performance by adjusting the voltage bounds within the AC-OPF. Contrary to typically used formulations of the integrated expansion planning problem, the constraints considered here include all main aspects of system operation, namely unit commitment, energy storage system management, AC-OPF, and reactive power compensation. Thus, in this paper, we examine how both the proposed transmission expansion modeling developments and the interrelation of the integrated planning constraints affect the computation of the solution to the expansion planning problem. The performance of this formulation is assessed on the RTS-GMLC test system by computing the expansion plan and comparing it with the results of three other expansion planning formulations most frequently employed in the recent literature to address the integrated expansion planning problem for medium to large-scale systems. Expansion plans are computed and compared for different case studies and multiple scenarios. According to the comparative analysis, neglecting the AC-OPF or the unit commitment constraints can increase the total system costs by 7.10%–9.57% or 6.29%–8.39%, respectively. Unlike other modeling approaches, the proposed approach does not rely on simplifications that impact the quality of the solution. Thanks to the incorporated cycle-based AC-OPF constraints and the consideration of a bound tightening procedure, the computation time is reduced by 17.67%–27.21%.

        This study presents an innovative optimization model for the self-scheduling of a hydrogen-based virtual power plant (H2-VPP) that aims to thrive in day-ahead energy and reserve markets. At its core, the model seeks to optimize profits by integrating a mix of renewable sources, battery storage, electrolyzers, and hydrogen storage, highlighting the model's focus on both electricity and hydrogen networks within a unified operational framework. Designed to navigate the complexities of a VPP, the model excels at strategically managing diverse resources for energy and reserve markets, emphasizing optimal operation of all assets. It accounts for the interplay between electricity and hydrogen production, storage, and demand, and addresses the time constraints critical to increasing revenues and ensuring balanced supply. A case study demonstrates the model's effectiveness, highlighting the role of hydrogen storage in increasing renewable integration and revenues. This underscores the model's ability to leverage the unique dynamics of electricity and hydrogen within the H2-VPP, confirming its potential in a rapidly evolving energy landscape.

        This paper presents a cost-based TSO-DSO coordination model to quantify the value of local flexibility services and analyze its impact on the transmission grid expansion and the system operation. Flexibility is provided to the DC power flow transmission grid model by microgrids within the integrated AC power flow distribution grid model. The model’s objective is to minimize the overall cost of transmission investments and procured flexibility and is achieved using a bilevel optimization approach where the power exchanges on all connected grid interfaces are controlled. Case studies using a combined test system of the IEEE RTS-96 transmission network interfacing multiple 33-bus distribution grids were performed to validate the model and assess the values and impacts of local flexibility on the transmission system expansion. The results showed that the proposed model modified the investment plan and dispatch of flexibility resources reducing the investment and operation cost of the transmission system.

        This study presents a methodology to solve simultaneously the alternating current (AC) transmission network expansion and reactive power planning problems, considering multiple stages and operating conditions. A mixed-integer non-linear programming model for the proposed planning problem is presented and rewritten with semidefinite structures. Then, the generalised Benders decomposition is used to separate the overall problem into an upper-level (master) problem and several lower-level (slaves) problems. The master problem is a mixed-integer linear programming problem that optimises the investment cost and constraints of the multistage expansion. Each slave problem minimises the operating costs associated with each stage and operating condition (normal operation or contingency), considering the AC power flow via semidefinite relaxation. With the proposed methodology, the global optimality of generalised Benders decomposition can be preserved due to the use of semidefinite relaxation in each slave problem. Garver's 6-bus system and an IEEE 118-bus system are used to show the precision and convergence to near-global optimal solutions with small relaxation gaps through the proposed approach.

        This paper proposes a two-stage stochastic market clearing (SMC) model based on a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation. The SMC model aims at determining the day-ahead schedule (DA) and the real-time (RT) balance settlement that minimize the total expected production cost. The network capacity constraints are considered in the proposed model through an AC power flow formulation, while the uncertainty in the renewable-based generation is taking into account using a set of stochastic scenarios. In order to solve the proposed non-linear programming model, a SDP relaxation is used. An illustrative example (3-bus test system) and the IEEE Reliability 24-bus test system are used to show the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed model. Results shown that the proposed SDP relaxation introduce a negligible error, when compared with the solution after solving the original non-linear model.
