    <div class="abstract" id="abs1">
      This paper presents a novel mixed-integer linear optimization formulation of the AC network-constrained, cost-based, integrated expansion planning problem. The formulation is used to determine the investment needs per technology including the location and sizing of new generation, energy storage, and transmission network assets in a future low-carbon power system. To reduce the size of the resulting problem, the AC optimal power flow (AC-OPF) model is represented in a compact way using cycle constraints. A bound tightening procedure is also considered to reduce the search space and improve the solver performance by adjusting the voltage bounds within the AC-OPF. Contrary to typically used formulations of the integrated expansion planning problem, the constraints considered here include all main aspects of system operation, namely unit commitment, energy storage system management, AC-OPF, and reactive power compensation. Thus, in this paper, we examine how both the proposed transmission expansion modeling developments and the interrelation of the integrated planning constraints affect the computation of the solution to the expansion planning problem. The performance of this formulation is assessed on the RTS-GMLC test system by computing the expansion plan and comparing it with the results of three other expansion planning formulations most frequently employed in the recent literature to address the integrated expansion planning problem for medium to large-scale systems. Expansion plans are computed and compared for different case studies and multiple scenarios. According to the comparative analysis, neglecting the AC-OPF or the unit commitment constraints can increase the total system costs by 7.10%–9.57% or 6.29%–8.39%, respectively. Unlike other modeling approaches, the proposed approach does not rely on simplifications that impact the quality of the solution. Thanks to the incorporated cycle-based AC-OPF constraints and the consideration of a bound tightening procedure, the computation time is reduced by 17.67%–27.21%.

    <div class="abstract" id="abs2">
      Long-term energy planning increasingly relies on mathematical models offering quantitative insight to support complex policy decisions. However, the increase in their use has meant the proliferation of tools developed at different institutions, with various scopes, dealing with specific aspects of the economy, the power sector, or the climate, with mismatches in temporal or geographic resolution. All this creates a need for using several models concurrently, integrating them to generate a complete perspective on the implications of policy decisions on the energy transition. This article proposes a methodology to categorize and combine energy models and develop a manipulation strategy to answer a target research question. Thus, it gives a formal structure to tasks carried out informally −and suboptimally- in virtually any energy planning project. This methodology is based on structured modeling, a formal mathematical theory conceived for representing and manipulating models. It assumes a soft-linking approach, meaning the models share information without integrating them within the same platform or code. This framework was developed within the European project openENTRANCE, which will develop, use, and disseminate an open, transparent, and integrated modeling platform for assessing low-carbon transition pathways in Europe.

        This study presents an innovative optimization model for the self-scheduling of a hydrogen-based virtual power plant (H2-VPP) that aims to thrive in day-ahead energy and reserve markets. At its core, the model seeks to optimize profits by integrating a mix of renewable sources, battery storage, electrolyzers, and hydrogen storage, highlighting the model's focus on both electricity and hydrogen networks within a unified operational framework. Designed to navigate the complexities of a VPP, the model excels at strategically managing diverse resources for energy and reserve markets, emphasizing optimal operation of all assets. It accounts for the interplay between electricity and hydrogen production, storage, and demand, and addresses the time constraints critical to increasing revenues and ensuring balanced supply. A case study demonstrates the model's effectiveness, highlighting the role of hydrogen storage in increasing renewable integration and revenues. This underscores the model's ability to leverage the unique dynamics of electricity and hydrogen within the H2-VPP, confirming its potential in a rapidly evolving energy landscape.

        This paper presents a cost-based TSO-DSO coordination model to quantify the value of local flexibility services and analyze its impact on the transmission grid expansion and the system operation. Flexibility is provided to the DC power flow transmission grid model by microgrids within the integrated AC power flow distribution grid model. The model’s objective is to minimize the overall cost of transmission investments and procured flexibility and is achieved using a bilevel optimization approach where the power exchanges on all connected grid interfaces are controlled. Case studies using a combined test system of the IEEE RTS-96 transmission network interfacing multiple 33-bus distribution grids were performed to validate the model and assess the values and impacts of local flexibility on the transmission system expansion. The results showed that the proposed model modified the investment plan and dispatch of flexibility resources reducing the investment and operation cost of the transmission system.

    <div class="abstract" id="abs5">
        The expansion of the transmission network will be a key enabler of the energy transition. However, the high level of technical detail involved in network studies, where a DCPF and the consideration of discrete investment are necessary, meant that it was accessible only to very specialized researchers. OpenTEPES changes the picture by providing an open-access tool with full functionality. OpenTEPES determines the investment plans for new power facilities (generating units and lines) necessary to supply future demand at minimum cost. OpenTEPES represents hierarchically the different time scopes involved in the planning decisions, from the medium to the very long term. It includes the uncertainty related to system operation, such as the availability of renewable energy sources and electricity demand, and multiple criteria such as investment cost or carbon emissions. OpenTEPES is a flexible tool that has been applied to planning projects in a European context. It has been developed as part of the H2020 project OpenENTRANCE and is now available open-source for the energy planning community.
